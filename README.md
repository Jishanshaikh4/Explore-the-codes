# Explore-the-codes
> A collection of computer programs to learn, explore, and evaluate. Understand the problem, give a big punch to it, think more of it, tired. Now look up here. Run it? Like it? go home with a little new knowledge. Your helping hand to competitve programming (Beware of Plagiarism!). Nail the technical interviews with confidence.

## More Information

### What is it and How can you use it?
Take a look at any of the code. You are encouraging to first read and understand the code (If you can) and then try to guess output when that code run. Now run the code and find what's the difference. Understand implementational details along with syntactical information of language. Do whatever you want to do with these. Good? Right. Suggestions? Leave a pull request.
